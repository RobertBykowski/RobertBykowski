- 👋 Hi, I’m @RobertBykowski

An employee with 30 years of professional experience. I have completed many projects throughout my career. Each project represents an example of new knowledge and new relationships with people with whom I have worked. I feel well-suited to working in a team and I am looking for a role in this type of environment. I am currently looking for a job that would allow me to further develop my competencies in the field of IT, software development or cyber security consulting. At the same time, I would like to express my full readiness to acquire new skills and learn foreign languages.
